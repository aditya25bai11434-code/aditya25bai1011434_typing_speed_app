Project Report: Typing Speed Test (Python)

1. Introduction

This project is a small but fun Python program that checks how fast a person can type.
It shows a sentence, asks the user to type it, and then calculates how many words they typed per minute.
The goal was to build something simple, interactive, and useful while learning basic Python concepts.


2. Purpose of the Project

The main idea behind this project was:

To create a quick typing speed test.

To measure typing time and words typed.

To practice Python basics like inputs, timers, and simple calculations.


It’s a beginner-friendly project that helps build confidence in writing real programs.


3. Tools Used

Python 3
That’s it. No extra libraries or installations were needed.

4. How the Program Works

1. The program displays a sentence to the user.


2. When the user presses ENTER, the test begins.


3. The user types the sentence and presses ENTER again.


4. Python measures how long the user took.


5. It counts the words and calculates the Words Per Minute (WPM).



The logic is simple, and everything happens inside the terminal.


5. What the Program Does

After typing the sentence, the program shows:

 Time taken

Words typed

Typing speed (WPM)


It gives the user a quick idea of how fast they type.

6. Conclusion

Even though this is a small project, it’s a great example of how Python can create real, interactive tools.
It helped in understanding input handling, time measurement, and basic string processing.
This project can also be improved in the future by adding accuracy checking, random sentences, or even a GUI.
